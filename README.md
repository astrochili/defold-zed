# Zed + Defold

Here I collect any ideas on how to adapt the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) editor for Defold game development.

The editor is now in an active stage of development, so many things are still to come. I plan to keep an eye on it and catch useful updates.

## Settings

Zed by default uses a 4 space indent for Lua. To fix this, add the following to `settings.json`:

```json
"language_overrides": {
  "Lua": {
    "tab_size": 2
  }
}
```

## Lua Language Server

Zed already includes [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) and all we have to do is setup the [`.luarc.json`](.luarc.json) file. I don't know how to share it between projects yet.

## Defold API

As usual it's local folder [`.defold`](.defold) included generated headers with [defold-api-emmylua](https://github.com/d954mas/defold-api-emmylua).

Would be good idea to place it to some shared space and add path to it in `.luarc.json` to reuse between projects.

## File Associations

Files with the extension `*.script` and other types provided by Defold are not recognized as Lua in the Zed editor.

I think it will be supported very soon, upvote üëç and watch for updates https://github.com/zed-industries/community/issues/595.

### Workaround

Meanwhile, specifying a language type each time you open a file is possible, but it does not start the Language Server. Nevertheless, when you really need it, there is a hack how to start and language server, but only for one file:

- Restart the editor
- Open the desired file without touching any other Lua files.
- Select language type `Lua` (I added the `"cmd-shift-l": "language_selector::Toggle"` shortcut for this)
- At this point, the Lua Language Server starting to check updates, after which it's enabled for the unknown file type as well.

## Build and Debug

There's no way to do it yet. Upvote üëç and watch for updates https://github.com/zed-industries/community/issues/811.


The only thing there is is a terminal from which you can run any commands.
