# Zed + Defold

Here I collect any ideas on how to adapt the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) editor for Defold game development.

The editor is now in an active stage of development, so many things are still to come. I plan to keep an eye on it and catch useful updates.

## Settings

Zed by default uses a 4 space indent for Lua. To fix this, add the following to `settings.json`:

```json
"language_overrides": {
  "Lua": {
    "tab_size": 2
  }
}
```

## Lua Language Server

Zed already includes [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) and all we have to do is setup the [`.luarc.json`](.luarc.json) file.

It would be better to share it between projects somewhere, but don't know how to do it yet.

## Defold API

As usual it's local folder [`.defold`](.defold) included generated headers with [defold-api-emmylua](https://github.com/d954mas/defold-api-emmylua).

It would be a good idea to place it to some shared place and set path in the `.luarc.json` file to reuse the api folder between projects.

## File Associations

Files with the extension `*.script` and other types provided by Defold are not recognized as Lua in the Zed editor.

I think it will be supported very soon, upvote üëç and watch for updates https://github.com/zed-industries/community/issues/595.

### Workaround

Meanwhile, specifying a language type each time you open a file is possible, but it does not start the Language Server. Nevertheless, when you really need it, there is a hack how to start and language server, but only for one file:

- Restart the editor
- Open the desired file without touching any other Lua files.
- Select language type `Lua` (I added the `"cmd-shift-l": "language_selector::Toggle"` shortcut for this)
- At this point, the Lua Language Server starting to check updates, after which it's enabled for the unknown file type as well.

## Build and Debug

There's no way to do it yet. Upvote üëç and watch for updates https://github.com/zed-industries/community/issues/811.

The only thing there is is a terminal from which you can run any commands.

### Debug in Terminal

There is a minimalistic cli [debugger.lua](https://github.com/slembcke/debugger.lua). I havn't tested it with Defold yet, because it requires to run `bob.jar` from Zed terminal and etc., but it works fine with pure Lua. It may help if the need for debugging is modest and infrequent and you would like to do it inside Zed environment.
